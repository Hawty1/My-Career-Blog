#### Introduction

>Since this is the first day of my Blog I will start with introduce myself.
>My name is _*Marius Erpenbach*_, I'm 26 years old and live near cologne in Germany. 
>about 2 years ago I quitted my old job as a butcher because I was getting frustrated and
>and depressive by working in that industry.  
>Even though it was not easy due to financial and personal risks, I made the big step  
>and said _good-bye_ to my old colleagues. 
>
>During this period I had a girlfriend who was not able to work physically since she  
>could having seizures anytime. The doctors said it would be to dangerous for her 
>because she has something like epilepsy. She took up the idea of getting into  
>programming, so I helped her and started to learn with her. We gathered books about the  
>topic, used some Apps like (Sololearn.com), and then tried to code some small programs.
>Unfortunately she lost the interest in the topic after a while and went on with other  
>things. And even more unfortunately she lost her interest in me too.
>
>But as I helped her learning I felt into coding by myself and picked it up. I kept the  
>material we hoarded so far by myself and kept learning.
>
>Meanwhile I was working as a scaffolder to pay my bills and for living.
>But the idea of working as a coder was getting louder and louder every day. so it 
>motivated me to buy more reading material. Also I knew someone who was already working  
>in the industry, he recommended me some things I needed to start to learning everything  
>propperly. 
>
>In 2019 I had an accident, nothing to dramatic - jumped on someones shoulders during carneval in Wuppertal and  
>felt onto the ground - I suffered an injury which stopped me from working physically for a couple of month.
>Again I used the time to focus more on reading about coding and starting my own first projects.
>
>In December 2020 I had the special opportunity to join the DCI - Digital Career Institute.
>They provide a yearly course on how to get into the industry. Due to corona it's all online in Webcam-Sessions.

### Javascript Tutorial
A while ago I have started to write down all the lessons I learned with free-learning apps on paper. But I have to say that it helped me a lot to understand the syntax JS.
I want to share the lessons I learned in this Blog to improve my coding skills. To challenge myself a bit more I will use another example codes as I have already written down. The structure should be in a new directory cause I probably need to separate it different topics.
